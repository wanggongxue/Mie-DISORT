# Mie-DISORT
Mie-DISORT models snow bidirectional reflectance and albedo. BRDF, HDRF, ARF, plane albedo (black-sky albedo) and spherical albedo (white-sky albedo) of snowpack can be conveniently obtained with Mie-DISORT.
It uses Mie calculations to represent single scattering properties of spherical ice particles. DISORT is used to solve the radiative transfer equation for a uniform snow layer.
It can also simulate the effects of snow grain shape with the use of SNICAR look-up table.
